The data directory includes the source data and code necessary to recreate all main and supplemental figures. The data directory has two subdirectories: 'study' and 'TCGA'. The 'study' subdirectory features analysis of the clinical dataset collected at MSKCC, while the 'TCGA' subdirectory represents the data set and analysis that replicate our observations.

All necessary data files to reproduce all the figures are available in the 'data' folder and include:

C_GAS_gene_list_KEGG

Clinical_phenotypes

Epigentic_pathway_genes

Gene_lists_for_ddGSEA.txt

GLMnet_Functions.R
